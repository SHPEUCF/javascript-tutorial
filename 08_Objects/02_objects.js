/*
2. OBJECTS

JavaScript objects are containers that
can store data and functions.

The data we store in an object is not
ordered â€” we can only access it by
calling its associated key.

You can create an object with key-value
airs using the following syntax:
*/

let restaurant = {
  name: 'Italian Bistro',
  seatingCapacity: 120,
  hasDineInSpecial: true,
  entrees: ['Penne alla Bolognese', 'Chicken Cacciatore', 'Linguine Pesto']
};

/* 

Keys point to values which can hold any
kind of data type, like strings, numbers,
booleans, arrays, and even functions
(we will get to that later).

/*

1. Make a variable named person and
set it equal to an object. Inside the
object, make a key named name and set
it's value to a string of your name.

2. Create a second key inside person
named age and set its value to your age as a number.
