6. NPM INIT

In the next five exercises you will learn
how to setup a JavaScript project that
transpiles code when you run npm run build
from the root directory of a JavaScript project.

- the first step is to place your ES6
JavaScript file in a directory called src.
From your root directory, the path to
the ES6 file is ./src/main.js

- to use node package, remember you have to
have Node.js install and its package manager
npm

- Before adding Babel to our project we need to
run npm init. This created a file named
package.json the the root directory where
we can adjust some settings

- A package.json file contains information
about the current JavaScript project

-- Metadata — This includes a project
title, description, authors, and more.

-- A list of node packages required for the
project — If another developer wants to run
your project, npm looks inside package.json
and downloads the packages in this list.

-- Key-value pairs for command line scripts —
You can use npm to run these shorthand scripts
to perform some process. It's like shortcuts
for long commands

- if you have node install, you can create the
package.json by typeing npm init

-- You'll be prompted to fill in fields for the
project

- You are not required to answer the prompts,
though we recommend at minimum,
you add your own title and description.
If you don't want to fill in a field, you can
press enter.

- npm adds the package.json file to the same
level as the src directory.

1. Run ls in the terminal window to see
current file structure

2. use npm to create a new package.json

Use npm to create a new package.json file.
We recommend you set the name and description
properties to the following values:

    name — learning-babel
    description — Use Babel to transpile
    JavaScript ES6 to ES5

Enter ls into the terminal to see the file
structure of your current directory. Notice the addition of package.json.
