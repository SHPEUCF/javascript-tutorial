4. WHY ES6?

The version of JavaScript that preceded ES6
is called JavaScript ES5.

Some reasons for the ES5 to ES6 updates are:

- A similarity to other programming languages

— JavaScript ES6 is syntactically more similar
 to other object-oriented programming languages.
 This leads to less friction when experienced,
 non-JavaScript developers want to learn
 JavaScript.

- Readability and economy of code —
The new syntax is often easier to
understand (more readable) and requires
fewer characters to create the same
functionality (economy of code).

- Addresses sources of ES5 bugs —
Some ES5 syntax led to common bugs.
With ES6, Ecma introduced syntax that
mitigates some of the most common pitfalls.

// ANSWER

var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara ='You can make carbonara with' + pasta + ', ' + meat + ', ' + 'and a sauce made with' + sauce + '.';
