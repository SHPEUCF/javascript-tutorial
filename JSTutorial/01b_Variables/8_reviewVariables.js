/*
8. SUMMARY VARIABLES

Let's review what we learned:

  - Variables hold reusable data in a program.

  - JavaScript will throw an error if you try
    to reassign const variables.

  - Reassign variables with the let keyword.

  - Unset variables store the primitive data
    type undefined.

  - Mathematical assignment operators make
    it easy to calculate a new value and
    assign it to the same variable.

  - The + operator is used to interpolate
    (combine) multiple strings.

  - In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${}
    are used to interpolate values into a
    string.

  - Mention var keyword in ES5 so they know
    when they see it
