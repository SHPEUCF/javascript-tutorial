/*
1. MATHEMATICAL ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

Used to calculate new values and assign them
to a variable

let x = 4;
x = x + 1;

Save time, DRY principle

let x = 4;
x += 2; // x equals 6 (adds)

let y = 4;
y -= 2; // y equals 2 (subtract)

let z = 4;
z *= 2; // z equals 8 (multiply)

let r = 4;
r++; // r equals 5 (increment by 1)

let t = 4;
t--; // t equals 3 (decrement by 1)

/*

 1. Add 16 to molecule's value

 2. Particle, itself multiplied by 6.02

 3. increment assay by 1

 */

// Example

let molecule = 16;
let particle = 18;
let assay = 3;

// Add and assign to molecule below
molecule += 16;

// Multiply and assign to particle below
particle *= 6.02;

// Increment assay by 1
assay++;
