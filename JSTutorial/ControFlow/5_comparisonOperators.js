/*
5. COMPARISON OPERATORS

sometimes we need to compare variables
to other values. We can achieve this with
comparison operators.

There are two comparisons you might be familiar
with:

    Less than: <
    Greater than: >

You may also recognize these:

    Less than or equal to: <=
    Greater than or equal to: >=

These comparisons evaluate to true or false.

/*

 1. Use let and declare hungerLevel = 5;

 2. Write an if/else statement that checks
 if hungerLevel is greater than 7.
 If so, log Time to eat!. Otherwise, log We can eat later!.

 3. Run, then change hungerLevel = 10;
    Run again

 */

// Example
let hungerLevel = 5;

if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log('We can eat later!');
};
