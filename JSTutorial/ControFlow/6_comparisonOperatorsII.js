6. COMPARISON OPERATORS II

two more useful comparisons we can make.
Often, we might want to check if two things are
equal to each other or if they are not.


    - To check if two things equal each other,
    we write === (three = signs in a row).

    - To check if two things do not equal
    each other, we write
    !== (an exclamation with two = signs in a row).
