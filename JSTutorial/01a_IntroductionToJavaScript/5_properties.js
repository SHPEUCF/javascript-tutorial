/*
5. Properties

JavaScript values as an instance of a data type
have properties by default.

Like string 'Hello', has additional information
attached to it. You can access this infomation by using
the properties.

For example, every string instance has a property
called length that stores the number of characters in it.
You can retrieve property information by appending the
string with a period and the property name:

'Hello'.length; this returns 5
