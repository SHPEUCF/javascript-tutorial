1. Introduction to Requests with ES6

Introduction to Requests with ES6

Asynchronously requesting and
responding to data is such an integral
part of what developers do with
JavaScript that a new type of object,
called a Promise, was added to
JavaScript in ES6.


A Promise is an object that acts as a
placeholder for data that has been
requested but not yet received.
Eventually, a Promise will resolve
to the value requested or to a
reason why the request failed.


If the requested information or any
error except a network error is
received, the Promise is fulfilled and
calls a function to handle the
response. If there is a network error,
the Promise is rejected and will
call a function to handle the error.


In this lesson, you will learn
how to use the fetch() function,
which uses Promises to handle
requests. You will also learn how
to use the .then() method to handle
fulfilled and rejected Promises.
Finally, you will make this all
simpler using the async and await
keywords.
