/*
12. $.ajax() POST Requests I

Using the $.ajax() method for POST
requests is very similar to using it
for GET requests. The main differences
are the type property, which will have a
value of POST and the inclusion of the
data property, which will have a value
of an object passed to the JSON.stringify()
method.
